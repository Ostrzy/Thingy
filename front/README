```
elm-package install
elm-reactor
```

Go to: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)


I don't know a clean way to depend on a non-published package, so making it works required a few hacks:
1. I copied the package by hand to elm-stuff/packages (non-related: I changed the constructor of SocketEvent from Message to Msg, otherwise it wouldn't compile)
2. I specified the package by hand in both elm-stuff/exact-dependecies.json and elm-dependencies.json
3. I specified not to gitignore that parts of elm-stuff

Assuming you had elm-core already installed, and you don't need any new packages, it should work. But if you want to install or update any existing package, elm-package install will fail when trying to look for elm-websockets. As a workaround:
-remove the dependency from elm-package.json
-install what you need
-run elm-reactor, see if the compilation fails due to websockets not installed
-add the dependency back
-run the program
